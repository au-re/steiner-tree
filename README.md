# Graphical Steinertree Problem
Laboratory Project for the course 'Computational Intelligence' 2015-2016 at the UPC, Barcelona

Our idea was to tackle some combinatorial optimization problem called Steinertree Graph problem. 
This problem is proven to be NP-hard. We used genetic algorithms to solve it.
